## FAQ

#### What is Stack?

- A linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
- The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

#### What are Operations on Stack?

- Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they were pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the stack.
